## About

This repository contains personal projects focused on building robust ETL pipelines and web scraping solutions. The projects demonstrate expertise in extracting, transforming, and loading data from diverse sources, including APIs with varying response formats and dynamic web pages.

A core focus is on understanding and handling complex data structures such as nested dictionaries, JSON, XML, and intricate HTML layouts. These projects emphasize practical skills in parsing, cleaning, and transforming heterogeneous data into structured formats suitable for analysis and reporting.

By working with multiple response structures and dynamic content, these projects showcase key data engineering techniques essential for scalable and reliable data workflows.
